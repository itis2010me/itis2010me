{\bf{Robotic Arm Project} (2020)}\\
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Study of a specialized two segments robotic arm with computational algebra.
\item Analysis of many real life robotic arm problems such as kinematics singularity and reversed kinematics problems. 
\item Calculations made using Maple.
\item Highlights the integration of computer and mathematics. 
\end{itemize}

{\bf{RSA Encryption and Modular Arithmetic} (2019)}\\
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Insight look into RSA encryption through the lens of computer science and mathematics
\item Provided several detailed mathematical proof for the theorems such as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and Euler's Phi function. 
\end{itemize}

{\bf{Empirical Analysis of Sorting Algorithms} (2018)}\\
